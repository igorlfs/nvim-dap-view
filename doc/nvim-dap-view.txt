INSTALLATION                        *nvim-dap-view-nvim-dap-view-installation*


VIA LAZY.NVIM ~

>lua
    return {
        {
            "igorlfs/nvim-dap-view",
            opts = {},
        },
    }
<

For a better experience, consider adding `nvim-dap-view` **as a dependency**
for `nvim-dap` (instead of declaring it as a standalone plugin)

Why? ~

By default, when launching a session, `nvim-dap`’s terminal window takes half
the screen. As a saner default, `nvim-dap-view` hijacks the terminal window
(even if not invoked), making the split take only 12 (configurable) lines.

>lua
    -- Your nvim-dap config
    return {
        {
            "mfussenegger/nvim-dap",
            dependencies = {
                { "igorlfs/nvim-dap-view", opts = {} },
                ...,
            },
            ...,
        },
    }
<


FEATURES                                *nvim-dap-view-nvim-dap-view-features*

The plugin provides 5 "views" that share the same window (so there’s clutter)

- Watches view
    - Shows a list of (user defined) expressions, that are evaluated by the debug adapter
    - Add, edit and delete expressions from the watch list
        - Including adding the variable under the cursor

- Exceptions view
    - Control when the debugger should stop, outside of breakpoints (e.g.,
        whenever an exception is thrown, or when an exception is caught).
    - Toggle filter with `<CR>`

- Breakpoints view
    - List all breakpoints
        - Uses syntax highlighting
        - Shows filename and number line
    - Jump to a breakpoint with `<CR>`

- Threads view
    - List all threads and their stack traces
    - Jump to a function in the call stack
    - Toggle `subtle` (hidden) frames with `t`

- REPL view
    - Use REPL provided by nvim-dap

You can also interact with the console provided by `nvim-dap` (though,
arguably, that’s not a feature from `nvim-dap-view`). By the default, the
console has its own window, but it can be configured to be shown with the other
views.

The console’s default size (height) is resized to match your `nvim-dap-view`
configuration. You can also either completely |nvim-dap-view-hide| it (if
it’s not being used at all) or hide it only during session initialization.


DOCUMENTATION                      *nvim-dap-view-nvim-dap-view-documentation*


CONFIGURATION ~

Default options ~

>lua
    return {
        winbar = {
            show = true,
            sections = { "watches", "exceptions", "breakpoints", "threads", "repl" },
            -- Must be one of the sections declared above
            default_section = "watches",
        },
        windows = {
            height = 12,
            terminal = {
                -- 'left'|'right'|'above'|'below': Terminal position in layout
                position = "left",
                -- List of debug adapters for which the terminal should be ALWAYS hidden
                hide = {},
                -- Hide the terminal when starting a new session
                start_hidden = false,
            },
        },
    }
<


USAGE ~

Start a regular debugging session. When desired, you can use `:DapViewOpen` to
start the plugin. You can switch to a view (section) using the letter outlined
in the `'winbar'` (e.g., `B` for the breakpoints view).

Both the breakpoints view and the exceptions view have only 1 mapping: `<CR>`.
It jumps to a breakpoint and toggles an exception filter, respectively. The
watches view comes with 3 mappings:

- `i` to insert a new expression
- `e` to edit an expression
- `d` to delete an expression

Though, the preferred way of adding a new expression is using the
`:DapViewWatch` command. In normal mode, it adds the variable under the cursor
to the watch list. The threads view has 2 mappings:

- `<CR>` jumps to a location in the call stack
- `t` toggles subtle frames

When you finish your session, you can use `:DapViewClose` to close the
`nvim-dap-view` window.

In total, there are 4 commands:

- `DapViewOpen`
- `DapViewClose`
- `DapViewToggle`
- `DapViewWatch`

Additionally, you can use `DapViewClose!` and `DapViewToggle!` to also hide the
terminal window, if you prefer a tidy view.

If you prefer using lua functions, I got you covered! The following provide the
same functionality as above:

>lua
    require("dap-view").open()
    require("dap-view").close()
    require("dap-view").close(true) -- Same as `DapViewClose!`
    require("dap-view").toggle()
    require("dap-view").toggle(true) -- Same as `DapViewToggle!`
    require("dap-view").add_expr()
<

`nvim-dap-view` doesn’t define any keybindings (outside its own buffer, of
course). An example for the toggle functionality, using the lua API:

>lua
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>v", function()
        require("dap-view").toggle()
    end, { desc = "Toggle nvim-dap-view" })
<


RECOMMENDED SETUP ~


AUTOMATIC TOGGLE

If you find yourself constantly toggling `nvim-dap-view` once a session starts
and then closing on session end, you might want to add the following snippet to
your configuration:

>lua
    local dap, dv = require("dap"), require("dap-view")
    dap.listeners.before.attach["dap-view-config"] = function()
        dv.open()
    end
    dap.listeners.before.launch["dap-view-config"] = function()
        dv.open()
    end
    dap.listeners.before.event_terminated["dap-view-config"] = function()
        dv.close()
    end
    dap.listeners.before.event_exited["dap-view-config"] = function()
        dv.close()
    end
<


HIDE TERMINAL

Some debug adapters don’t use the integrated terminal (console). To avoid
having a useless window lying around, you can completely hide the terminal for
them. To achieve that, add the following snippet to your `nvim-dap-view` setup:

>lua
    -- Goes into your opts table (if using lazy.nvim), otherwise goes into the setup function
    -- No need to include the "return" statement (or the outer curly braces)
    return {
        windows = {
            terminal = {
                -- NOTE Don't copy paste this snippet
                -- Use the actual names for the adapters you want to hide
                -- `go` is known to not use the terminal.
                hide = { "go", "some-other-adapter" },
            },
        },
    }
<


TERMINAL POSITION AND INTEGRATION

When setting `windows.terminal.position` to `right` the views window may be
used to display the current breakpoint because `nvim-dap` defaults to the
global `switchbuf` setting. A common solution is to set `switchbuf` to
"useopen"

>lua
    require("dap").defaults.fallback.switchbuf = "useopen"
<

Ifyou are using an adapter that does not natively support the `nvim-dap`
integrated terminal, but you want to use the `nvim-dap-view` terminal anyway,
you can get the `winnr` and `bufnr` of the `nvim-dap-view` terminal via
`dap-view.state` and use `vim.fn.jobstart` to start your debug adapter in the
`nvim-dap-view` terminal! An example can be found here
<https://github.com/catgoose/nvim/blob/ffd88fd66ade9cad0da934e10308dbbfc76b9540/lua/config/dap/go.lua#L19-L48>


HIGHLIGHT GROUPS ~

`nvim-dap-view` defines 10 highlight groups:

>
    NvimDapViewMissingData
    NvimDapViewWatchText
    NvimDapViewWatchTextChanged
    NvimDapViewExceptionFilterEnabled
    NvimDapViewExceptionFilterDisabled
    NvimDapViewFileName
    NvimDapViewLineNumber
    NvimDapViewSeparator
    NvimDapViewThread
    NvimDapViewThreadStopped
<

They are linked to (somewhat) reasonable defaults, but they may look odd with
your colorscheme. Consider contributing to your colorscheme by sending a PR to
add support to `nvim-dap-view`.


FILETYPES AND AUTOCOMMANDS ~

`nvim-dap-view` sets buffer filetypes for the following Views

  Window                             Filetype
  ---------------------------------- ---------------
  watches, exceptions, breakpoints   dap-view
  terminal                           dap-view-term
These filetypes can be used to override buffer and window options set by
`nvim-dap-view`

Example autocommand ~

Map q to quit in `nvim-dap-view` filetypes:

>lua
    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({ "FileType" }, {
        pattern = { "dap-view", "dap-view-term", "dap-repl" }, -- dap-repl is set by `nvim-dap`
        callback = function(evt)
            vim.keymap.set("n", "q", "<C-w>q", { silent = true, buffer = evt.buf })
        end,
    })
<

NON-GOALS                              *nvim-dap-view-nvim-dap-view-non-goals*

Implement every feature from nvim-dap-ui
<https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-dap-ui>. More specifically,

- **There will be no “scopes” view** (i.e., list all variables in scope). The rationale is that `nvim-dap` already provides a very nice UI for that, using widgets (see |dap-widgets|). The TLDR is that you can use

>lua
    local widgets = require("dap.ui.widgets")
    widgets.centered_float(widgets.scopes, { border = "rounded" })
<

to create a nice, centered floating window, where you can navigate and explore
variables. A major advantage from this approach is that you’re not limited to
a small window at the bottom of your screen (which can be troublesome in noisy
environments or languages).

- Likewise, **there will be no “hover” view**, since that’s also perfectly handled by `nvim-dap`’s widgets. You can use

>lua
    require("dap.ui.widgets").hover(nil, { border = "rounded" })
<

to create a nice floating window to display the variable under the cursor.


KNOWN ISSUES                        *nvim-dap-view-nvim-dap-view-known-issues*

- Breakpoints view doesn’t show breakpoint conditions
    - That’s a limitation with the current breakpoints API from `nvim-dap`. We
        could use a workaround, but a new API is
        planned <https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap/issues/1388>


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS                *nvim-dap-view-nvim-dap-view-acknowledgements*

- nvim-dap-ui <https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-dap-ui> is obviously a huge inspiration!
- Code to inject treesitter highlights into line is taken from
    `quicker.nvim` <https://github.com/stevearc/quicker.nvim>;
- Some snippets are directly extracted from `nvim-dap`
    - Currently,there’s no API to extract breakpoint information (see
        issue <https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap/issues/1388>), so we
        resort to using nvim-dap internal mechanism, that tracks extmarks;
    - The magic to extract expressions from visual mode is also a courtesy of
        `nvim-dap`.
- lucaSartore <https://github.com/lucaSartore/nvim-dap-exception-breakpoints>
    for the inspiration for handling breakpoint exceptions;
- Kulala <https://github.com/mistweaverco/kulala.nvim> for the creative usage
    of neovim’s `'winbar'` to handle multiple views.
- blink.cmp <https://github.com/Saghen/blink.cmp/blob/main/lua/blink/cmp/config/utils.lua> for the config validation (which is partially taken from a PR to indent-blankline <https://github.com/lukas-reineke/indent-blankline.nvim/pull/934/files#diff-09ebcaa8c75cd1e92d25640e377ab261cfecaf8351c9689173fd36c2d0c23d94R16>)
