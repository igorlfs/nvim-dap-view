All of that in a unified, unintrusive window.

## Getting Started

Start a regular debugging session. When desired, you can use `:DapViewOpen` to start the plugin. You can switch to another section using the letter outlined in the `'winbar'` (e.g., `B` for "Breakpoints"). Explore what you can do each section by using `g?` to inspect the keymaps.

Once you're done debugging, you can close the plugin with `:DapViewClose` and then terminate your session as usual.

There's a lot more you can do: `nvim-dap-view` is highly customizable. To learn all the options, commands, tips and tricks, visit the full documentation on the [website](https://igorlfs.github.io/nvim-dap-view/home).
